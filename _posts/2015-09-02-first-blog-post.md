On the night before class began, there was a download party for us to start getting to know our class mates.

While going around introducing ourselves and saying how we came to be at the Iron Yard, it wasn't even the third person's turn that I had already started doubting myself and was
screaming **"what have I gotten myself into?**" in my head. Everyone had at least _some_ experience with coding, where as 
I had absolutely _none_. On top of that, I had literally just been dumped (the day before) by my boyfriend. I was an 
emotional wreck and my self-doubt increased dramatically with every passing second. To make matters worse, I was
desperately trying to take part in conversations but had asolutley **no clue** what anyone was talking about. It was 
then that I made a mental checklist for our first day of class the next day:

1. Remember to breathe.
2. Don't cry.  
  You will look like a _complete idiot_ if you do.  
  **This step is very important.**
3. If you're going to cry, wait until the end of class.
4. Take a ridiculous amount of notes.
5. Ask for help if you're confused.

By the end of class, the only steps I'd accomplished were steps 1 (_barely_) and 3. I went home during lunch to bawl my eyes
out and to talk to my brother, who always sets me straight. He told me:

>####Set a date and tell yourself "By this date I will have let myself fully feel all the pain and stress I'm going through. After this date I will suck it up, put on my big girl pants and focus on the task at hand".

So I did. I gave myself until the end of the week. To get the ball rolling, I knew I had to actually complete step 5 so
I messaged my instructor, Abby, and filled her in on my situation. **SO GLAD I DID THAT!** Two hours later when I had finally
collected myself, I went back up to school where Abby quickly turned from being my instructor into a super hero whose
super power is being a bad-a at coding and I was finally starting to understand some of this stuff.

When Thursday rolled around and we had begun working on our weekend projects, I had my first _"AH HA!"_ moment. I had
made up my mind that I was going to get everything finished for the small screen size, but couldn't for the life of
me figure out why my pictures weren't showing up. Considering I'm a night owl, I knew Abby was definitely already asleep and
that I wouldn't be able to ask her for help. So I googled and recoded, then googled and recoded, then googled and recoded,
and recoded some more when **it finally worked!** It was then that I realized:

>### Hey, maybe I can do this after all.  

Two weeks in and I can already tell that not only am I much stronger person now than I was when I first started, but
I with out a doubt made the right decision to pursue UI design and to do so through The Iron Yard. My perfectionism may be
affecting the amount of sleep I get right from working on assignments til wee hours of the morning, but at least I can
proudly say that **my CSS is looking a lot less like a crime scene and more like actual code**.
